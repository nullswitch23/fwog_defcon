"""fw — FreeWili OG BSP task runner (cross-platform).

Commands:
  fw build [app] [--baud N]  configure+build an app for the RP2040 target
  fw flash <app> [--uf2 P]   reboot the app's own CPU into BOOTSEL, then copy
                              its .uf2 (--uf2 for a UF2 built outside this
                              repo, e.g. a project consuming the BSP)
  fw bootloader              build and flash the display serial bootloader
  fw bootsel --cpu C|--port P  reboot one CPU into BOOTSEL, no button
  fw console [--cpu display|main] [--port P]
  fw test                    build+run the host CTest tree, the ogemu
                              harness (build-emu/), then tools/tests/
  fw emu [app] [--gui]       configure+build the host display emulator;
                              --gui opens the tkinter panel (no agent)
  fw new-app <name> --cpu display|main
  fw cam …                pan/tilt/snapshot the bench Wyze Cam Pan
                           (local docker-wyze-bridge; needs a local agent)
  fw fsbak [--out DIR] [--gui] [--push]
                          pull/restore a GlassBak FatFs dump on main CDC
Add --print to print the command(s) instead of running them.

`fw console` supersedes the `fw mon` that earlier versions of this file
promised: both are "read a CPU's USB CDC output", and one command with a
product-string filter covers the bootloader and applications alike. It
needs pyserial.

--baud sets the inter-CPU link rate. It is a CMake cache variable, not a
runtime flag, because the rate is compiled into BOTH binaries and they must
agree; selecting a slower rate therefore rebuilds. 12.5 Mbaud is the design
rate and the PL011 ceiling; the fallback ladder is 10000000, 8333333, then
6250000.

Flashing is UF2 drag-and-drop. BOOTSEL is no longer a physical act: a CPU
running code with USB up is identified by its USB product string and rebooted
into the bootloader by opening its CDC at 1200 baud (the hardware record and 30), so
`fw flash` targets exactly one CPU and exactly one RPI-RP2 volume can appear.
When the CPU cannot be identified -- an older binary that predates
fwog_usb_product(), or a hung one -- it falls back to asking you to press
BOOTSEL and waiting. `fw bootloader` is the once-per-board step that puts the
serial bootloader on the display CPU in the first place; after that, display
firmware arrives over the link inside main's UF2.

    Refuses rather than guesses when more than one matches: both RP2040s on
    this board can present a CDC at the same time, and attaching to the wrong
    one is confusing at exactly the moment you are debugging.

    WINDOWS: pyserial itself does not surface the product string (see
    _port_product) -- but do_console() calls this with _cpu_ports() rather
    than raw pyserial ports, and _cpu_ports() fills the product in from
    SetupAPI via _pnp_products(). So the filter DOES distinguish the
    bootloader on Windows, in the normal call path. The vendor-ID fallback
    described below is for a caller that passes raw pyserial ports instead
    (or when _pnp_products() itself comes back empty, e.g. no powershell.exe)
    -- there, a filtered search that finds nothing falls back to matching on
    vendor ID alone, and still refuses if that leaves more than one
    candidate.

    That fallback is also reachable with product strings fully intact, e.g.
    from _cpu_ports(): neither RP2040 might be running an image whose product
    matches this filter (an old image, or the wrong one) even though both
    report perfectly good strings. The "multiple matches" error below tells
    the two situations apart, so it never blames "this platform" for a
