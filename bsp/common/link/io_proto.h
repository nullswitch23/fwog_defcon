/* Application-level link messages for breakout I/O direction control.
 *
 * Types start at 0x20 because the hardware record freezes 0x01-0x1F for the
 * bootloader's own protocol and 0x00 as invalid. A display bootloader
 * already shipped in the field speaks that framing, so the range cannot be
 * widened later.
 *
 * Every struct below carries a _Static_assert on its size because both CPUs
 * put them on the wire unserialized (the hardware record). Byte 0 of every payload
 * is the message type (the hardware record).
 *
 * The reference sends the direction word TWICE and rejects a mismatch
 * (rpProcessHostCommand.cpp:52-59). That is deliberately not carried over:
 * link_frame.c already CRCs every frame, on a channel measured at zero
 * corrupt bytes across 58 consecutive 256-value sweeps (the hardware record), so a
 * duplicate field would be redundant integrity checking.
 *
 * Structs go on the wire as-is, like bl_proto.h's. Both ends are
 * little-endian Cortex-M0+, and every multi-byte member below is either
 * naturally aligned or -- unlike bl_proto.h -- inside a struct marked
 * __attribute__((packed)), so there is no serialization step and no
 * endianness conversion. The _Static_asserts are what make that safe rather
 * than merely true today.
 *
 * bl_proto.h lays down a rule this file's callers do NOT follow: "callers
 * must memcpy into a local struct rather than casting a pointer into a
 * receive buffer, because fwog_link_rx_t.buf has no alignment guarantee."
 * gpio/breakout.c and display_cpu/io_expander/ioexp_link.c both cast
 * directly into the receive buffer instead. That is not an oversight of the
 * same rule -- it is safe for a reason bl_proto.h's structs don't have:
 * `packed` tells the compiler these members may be unaligned, so it emits
 * byte-wise loads/stores instead of a single unaligned word access. The
 * bl_proto.h rule exists because ITS structs are plain (natural alignment
 * assumed); this file's structs opt out of that assumption entirely, which
 * is what makes the cast legal here and nowhere else in this repo's link
 * code.
 *
 * Every request (CONFIG_ENABLE, SET_DIRS) and its ACK carry a one-byte
 * `seq`. The display echoes back the seq of the message it is acking; main
 * increments a counter per message sent and rejects an ack whose seq does
 * not match the one just sent. Without this, a stale ack from a timed-out
 * attempt can satisfy the wait for the NEXT attempt -- see breakout.c's
 * wait_ack() and the design note in gpio/breakout.h. */
